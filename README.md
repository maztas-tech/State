# 🎭 The State Design Pattern
The State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It’s like having an object that adapts its behavior dynamically, based on its current state. This makes your code cleaner and easier to maintain, especially when dealing with multiple states and complex transitions.
